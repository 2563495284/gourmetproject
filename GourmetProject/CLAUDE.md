# GourmetProject — Game Studio Agent Architecture

Indie game development managed through coordinated Claude Code subagents.
Each agent owns a specific domain, enforcing separation of concerns and quality.

## Coordination Rules

## Collaboration Protocol

**User-driven collaboration, not autonomous execution.**
Every task follows: **Question -> Options -> Decision -> Draft -> Approval**

- Default to answering the user in Chinese unless they explicitly ask for another language
- Agents MUST ask "May I write this to [filepath]?" before using Write/Edit tools
- Agents MUST show drafts or summaries before requesting approval
- Multi-file changes require explicit approval for the full changeset
- No commits without user instruction
